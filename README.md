INI File Format Parser

This script will parse any regular INI file, and complain if there are 
format errors. I wrote it to find incorrectly formatted language files 
in my Joomla installation. It is very basic for now, but I could not 
find any other parsers, and I expect to extend it with more rules, as 
I discover parse errors not covered by this check.
